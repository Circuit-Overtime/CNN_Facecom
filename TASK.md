##  Challenge Overview

###  Task A: Gender Classification
- **Objective:** Predict the gender (male/female) of a person from face images captured in difficult lighting/weather conditions.
- **Dataset Structure:**
```
dataset/
â”œâ”€â”€ train/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ male/ # 1532 images
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ female/ # 394 images
â””â”€â”€ val/
â”œâ”€â”€ male/ # 317 images
â””â”€â”€ female/ # 105 images
```
- **Model Goal:** Train a binary classifier that is accurate, fair, and generalizes well on distorted or real-world images.

###  Task B: Face Matching (Face Verification)
- **Objective:** Match distorted face images to the correct identity folder using embeddings, **not** classification.
- **Dataset Structure:**
```
dataset/
â”œâ”€â”€ identities/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ person_001/
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ clean.jpg
â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ distorted/
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ img1.jpg
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ img2.jpg
â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ ... (total 7 distorted images)
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ person_002/
â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ ... (total: 877 identity folders)
```

- **Model Goal:** Learn a similarity-based system that embeds faces such that:
- Similar identities are **close in embedding space**
- Dissimilar faces are **far apart**
