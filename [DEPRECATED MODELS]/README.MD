# [DEPRECATED MODELS]

This folder contains models and scripts that were **used for experimentation, testing, or ablation studies** during the development of the CNN Facecom project, but are **not part of the final production pipeline**.

## Purpose

- **Testing alternative architectures** 
- **Experimenting with learning rates, optimizers, and loss functions**
- **Evaluating various data augmentation and preprocessing strategies**
- **Prototyping inference pipelines and metric calculations**
- **Comparing model performance under different settings**

## Notes

- Models and scripts here may be incomplete, less optimized, or use different data splits than the final production code.
- Results from these models informed the design and hyperparameters of the production models, but **should not be used for deployment or final evaluation**.
- For the latest, production-ready code and models, refer to the `README.md` in the `PRODUCTION/` directories.

## Typical Contents

- Experimental training scripts (PyTorch, Keras, etc.)
- Old checkpoints and model weights
- Prototype inference scripts
- Notebooks or scripts for rapid prototyping
